Just Another Text Editor
  
  
## Description
This is my module 19 assignment and it was yet another challenging but fun assignment to work on because it really put me and my classmates skills to the test. In this project I used tools like `webpack`, `idb`, and plenty more. Doing this project gave me the chance to see how much I have progreesed in this coure compared to when I first started.
