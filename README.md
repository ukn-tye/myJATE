## Description
This is the 19th challenge for my Coding bootcamp journey. For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to create a simple browser text editor that follows PWA best practices to make the application packagable, and installable.

This application was derived from starter code and utilizes a numerous amount of packages and tools such as `idb`, `workbox`, `wepback`, `babel`, and many more
